# Introduction
Data Preparer systematically explores a space of integration and cleaning options but can certainly make decisions that are not the ones the user would prefer. As a result, Data Preparer allows the user to refine how the data wrangle should happen, either by providing feedback on the results of the data preparation task or by changing parameters that
control how Data Preparer behaves, or annotate the constructs that can contribute to a solution.

# How to use feedback
By clicking on **end product** after wrangling the data, you will be able to submit feedback. 

At the bottom of the page, you can select either *cells* (individual attribute values) or *tuples* (complete rows), then by clicking on the entries in the table, you will mark the cells/rows with the selected attribute (green - relevant, red - non-relevant).

 Clicking `Submit feedback` saves your choices. If you are not happy with a change, scroll to the feedback section and remove it.
