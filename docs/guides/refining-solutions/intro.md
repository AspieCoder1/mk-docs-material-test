# Refining Solutions

## Motivation
Data Preparer is designed to automate data preparation, which in practice means searching the space of opportunities for cleaning and combining data sets, taking into account user-specified priorities. 

Data Preparer systematically explores a space of integration and cleaning options, guided by evidence, but can certainly make decisions that are not the ones the user would prefer. 
> This could be because certain data sets are out-of-date or unreliable in ways that only an expert could discern, because Data Preparer misses
> certain opportunities, or because some of the decisions made are not appropriate. 

## Refine Solutions features
Data Preparer allows the user to refine the way in which Data Preparer wrangles the data

- by providing feedback on the results of the data preparation task
- by changing parameters that control how Data Preparer behaves
- by annotating the constructs that can contribute to a solution
