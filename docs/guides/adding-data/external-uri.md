# Importing data from the web
If your data source is in a web server or the cloud, you can import them through the **add uri** feature.

2. Click on the **add uri** option. After this, you should get a prompt to enter a uri for your data source.

> Note: Enabling the always read option will force the source contents to be read ahead of every
wrangling process. If this option is not enabled, the source contents will be retrieved once and
cached locally.
