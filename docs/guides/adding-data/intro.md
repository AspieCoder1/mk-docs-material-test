# Adding Data
Data sources can be made available to Data Preparer as:

- Delimiter-separated files, where the delimiter is a comma, a tab, a semicolon, or a pipe character.
- Excel files.
- By connecting to relational databases.
In each case, it is advised that you take a moment to verify that the data is imported correctly. 
> Although extra effort has been put into importing source data as robust as possible, edge cases may surface related to encodings, uncommon data types, or system-specific settings.
