# Adding Data
Data sources can be made available to Data Preparer as (i) delimiter-separated files, where the delimiter is a comma, a tab, a semicolon, or a pipe > character, or (ii) excel files, or (iii) by connecting to relational databases. In each case, it is advised that you take a moment to verify that the data is > imported correctly since, although extra effort has been put into making importing source data as robust as possible, edge cases may surface related to e.g., > encodings, uncommon data types, or system-specific settings.
